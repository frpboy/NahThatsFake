<p><strong>🔍 Nah That's Fake</strong></p><p>Launch &amp; Growth Plan</p><p>Document 6 of 13</p><p>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━</p><p><strong>Document: </strong>Document 6 of 13 — Launch &amp; Growth Plan</p><p><strong>Version: </strong>v1.0 — MVP</p><p><strong>Date: </strong>February 2026</p><p><strong>Status: </strong>Draft — Growth Strategy</p><p><strong>Horizon: </strong>90-day post-launch plan</p><p><strong>Bot Handle: </strong>@NahThatsFakeBot</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>🚀 What This Document Covers</strong></p><p>The complete go-to-market and growth strategy for Nah That's Fake — from zero users to</p><p>5,000+ in 90 days with zero paid advertising.</p><p>Covers: the viral engine explained, pre-launch checklist, 3-phase launch plan, Telegram</p><p>group targeting strategy, referral activation playbook, content calendar, influencer</p><p>outreach templates, and the metrics dashboard to track it all.</p></td></tr></table><h1><strong>1. The Growth Engine — How This Bot Grows Itself</strong></h1><p>Most apps need paid ads to grow. Nah That's Fake has a built-in viral loop that makes every usage in a public group an advertisement. Understanding this is the most important thing in this document.</p><h2><strong>1.1 The Core Viral Loop</strong></h2><table><tr><td><p><strong>THE VIRAL LOOP</strong></p><p>① User sees suspicious image in a big group</p><p><strong>↓</strong></p><p>② Tags @NahThatsFakeBot to prove it's fake</p><p><strong>↓</strong></p><p>③ Bot replies PUBLICLY — 500 to 50,000 members see it</p><p><strong>↓</strong></p><p>④ Curious members click @NahThatsFakeBot — start the bot</p><p><strong>↓</strong></p><p>⑤ New users try it → share with their groups → loop repeats</p><p><strong>Zero ad spend. The product markets itself.</strong></p></td></tr></table><h2><strong>1.2 Why Telegram Groups Are the Perfect Launch Channel</strong></h2><ul><li>The average large Telegram crypto or news group has 5,000–100,000 members.</li><li>Arguments about fake content happen every single day in these groups.</li><li>When someone tags the bot to settle an argument, EVERYONE watching sees the result.</li><li>Telegram usernames are clickable — every @NahThatsFakeBot mention is a direct acquisition link.</li><li>Group admins are desperate for anti-scam tools — they are our B2B buyers.</li></ul><h2><strong>1.3 The Referral Amplifier</strong></h2><p>The viral loop is supercharged by the referral system. Once someone discovers the bot, they have a financial incentive to share it — +1 permanent credit per referral. The new user gets +2 credits just for joining via the link. Both sides win, and the bot spreads further.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>📊 Viral Coefficient Target</strong></p><p>Viral Coefficient (K) = (Average referrals per user) × (Conversion rate of referred users)</p><p>Target K &gt; 1.0 for organic exponential growth.</p><p>If: average user refers 2 friends, and 60% of those friends complete their first check:</p><p>K = 2 × 0.60 = 1.2  →  Exponential growth without any ad spend.</p><p>Track K weekly. If K drops below 0.8, focus effort on referral activation (see Section 5).</p></td></tr></table><h1><strong>2.

Quality over quantity — we need real usage data, not vanity signups.</p><p><strong>Tactics:</strong></p><ol><li>Personal network launch — message every person you know who is active in crypto or news Telegram groups. Ask them to try the bot and give feedback. Target: 20 users from personal network.</li><li>Join 10 large Telegram groups yourself — crypto, news, fact-checking, India tech. Lurk for 3 days. When an argument about a suspicious image or link breaks out, use the bot yourself to check it. The public result will attract attention.</li><li>Post in r/india, r/IndiaSpeaks, r/CryptoCurrency, r/Scams — a genuine post about the problem of deepfakes in Telegram with the bot as the solution. Be authentic, not spammy. Title suggestion: 'Built a Telegram bot that catches AI-generated images and phishing links — free to use.'</li><li>WhatsApp forward to 5–10 relevant contacts with a one-line pitch: 'I built a bot that catches fake images in Telegram — try it free: t.me/NahThatsFakeBot'. Ask each to forward to one group they think would find it useful.</li><li>Twitter/X thread — short thread: 'The problem with Telegram crypto groups + how I built a detector in 2 weeks.' Tag relevant Indian tech/crypto accounts.</li></ol><table><tr><td><p><strong>🎯 Phase 1 Exit Criteria</strong></p><p>✅  100 users have completed at least 1 check</p><p>✅  No critical bugs in any core flow</p><p>✅  At least 3 spontaneous group tags (not triggered by you) observed</p><p>✅  At least 1 piece of genuine user feedback received</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p><strong>PHASE 2</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Accelerate — Crack the Viral Groups</strong></p></td><td><p>Days 15–45</p></td></tr></table><p>Goal: 1,000 users. The viral loop must start working. Phase 2 is about systematically seeding the bot into large groups where it will spread on its own.</p><p><strong>Tactics:</strong></p><ol><li>Targeted group seeding — identify the top 50 Telegram groups in your target categories (see Section 4 for the full list). Join each group. When a relevant moment arises — a suspicious image is shared, a scam link is posted, an argument breaks out — use the bot. Do not spam. Be a genuine community member who happens to have a useful tool.</li><li>Approach group admins directly — DM the admin of each group you join. Pitch: 'I built a free anti-scam bot. You can add it to your group to automatically catch phishing links. No cost for the group.' Offer them the first month of Group Premium free as a trial.</li><li>Create your own seeder content — generate 5 'Can you spot the fake?' posts with a real image and an AI-generated version. Post in appropriate groups asking people to guess. Then reveal the answer using @NahThatsFakeBot. Educational content that naturally demonstrates the product.</li><li>Influencer micro-outreach — find 10 small-to-mid Indian tech/crypto creators on Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram (10k–200k followers). Offer free lifetime premium access in exchange for an honest try and mention if they find it useful. See Section 6 for outreach template.</li><li>ProductHunt launch — submit to ProductHunt. Target a Tuesday or Wednesday launch for maximum visibility. India tech community is active there. Even a #5 of the day result will drive meaningful traffic.</li></ol><table><tr><td><p><strong>🎯 Phase 2 Exit Criteria</strong></p><p>✅  1,000 total users</p><p>✅  At least 5 groups with the bot actively installed by admins</p><p>✅  Viral coefficient K &gt; 0.8 (tracked weekly)</p><p>✅  First paid conversion (any plan)</p><p>✅  Referral programme generating at least 20% of new signups</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p><strong>PHASE 3</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Monetise — Convert &amp; Compound</strong></p></td><td><p>Days 46–90</p></td></tr></table><p>Goal: 5,000 users, 25 Group Premium subscriptions, ₹15,000+ monthly revenue. Phase 3 focuses on converting the user base built in Phase 2 into paying customers and compounding the referral loop.</p><p><strong>Tactics:</strong></p><ol><li>Group Premium push — personally reach out to every admin of every group where the bot has been used organically. Pitch the value of auto-scan mode. Offer a 7-day free trial, no payment required upfront. Target: 50 trial activations, 25 convert to paid.</li><li>Referral activation campaign — send a bot message to all existing free users: 'You have [N] friends waiting to discover Nah That's Fake. Share your link and earn credits that never expire.' Include their personal referral link. Make it one tap to share.</li><li>Upgrade nudge sequence — build a 3-message sequence for users who have hit their daily limit more than 3 times: Day 1 of repeated limit hits: remind them of referral option. Day 3: show them how many checks Premium users get. Day 7: limited-time offer: ₹79 first month (20% off).</li><li>Case study content — by Day 60, you should have real examples of fake images the bot caught. Create anonymised case studies. Post on Twitter/LinkedIn: 'This image was shared 500 times in Indian Telegram groups last week. Our bot flagged it as 94% AI-generated.' Tag relevant journalists and fact-checkers.</li><li>Expansion to new group categories — Phase 1-2 focus is crypto and news. Phase 3: expand seeding into political groups, sports groups, entertainment groups. The deepfake problem is everywhere.</li></ol><table><tr><td><p><strong>🎯 Phase 3 Exit Criteria (90-Day Goals)</strong></p><p>✅  5,000 total registered users</p><p>✅  20,000+ total checks performed</p><p>✅  25 active Group Premium subscriptions</p><p>✅  ₹15,000+ monthly recurring revenue</p><p>✅  Viral coefficient K &gt; 1.0</p><p>✅  Referral programme driving &gt;25% of new signups</p></td></tr></table><h1><strong>4.
