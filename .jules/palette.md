## 2026-05-09 - Accessible Interactive Elements in Vanilla JS
**Learning:** When using vanilla HTML/JS without a UI framework, interactive elements like `.check-item` list items often lack native keyboard accessibility (relying only on `onclick`). Screen readers and keyboard navigators are excluded by default.
**Action:** Always verify custom interactive components have `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, and keydown handlers supporting `Enter` and `Space`. Adding `:focus-visible` ensures clear visual feedback without compromising mouse users.
## 2024-05-24 - Actionable Empty States
**Learning:** Generic empty states like "No checks yet" lead to dead ends during user onboarding, causing confusion about how to start using the app.
**Action:** Always provide actionable empty states that include a clear explanation and a call-to-action button (like opening the bot chat) to guide users on their next steps. Ensure these states are accessible using `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
## 2024-05-24 - Async Loading States and A11y for Payment Buttons
**Learning:** Actionable async buttons, especially for payments (like in `premium.html`), often lack `disabled` and `aria-busy` states during processing. This can lead to double-click submissions (double-charges) and leaves screen reader users unaware of the loading state. Furthermore, dynamic status messages need proper ARIA roles to be announced correctly.
**Action:** Always wrap async payment interactions with logic to disable action buttons and set `aria-busy="true"`. Use `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"` for dynamic error messages, and `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical status updates.
## 2026-05-13 - [Global A11y Statuses]
**Learning:** For dynamic updates in Telegram Mini Apps (like fetching checks or loading user profiles), screen readers miss the UI changes unless explicit ARIA live regions are used. Using `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for loading states, and `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"` for errors significantly improves the experience.
**Action:** When adding or modifying asynchronous frontend components, always ensure that success, loading, and error states have appropriate ARIA roles and live regions defined in both the static HTML and dynamic JS updates.
